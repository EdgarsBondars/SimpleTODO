By no means finished project.
I'm aware of issues like hard-coded connection string (has to be moved to user secrets).
Vue.js is not integrated to an extent I'd like.
Some unrelevant default files might be still present.

That's something I've created in a couple of hours.
On my github page there are couple of pet project's I've spent a bit more time on.
